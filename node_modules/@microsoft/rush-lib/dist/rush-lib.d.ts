     * will narrow any (compatible) SemVer range specifier.
     *
     * For example, suppose local project `A` depends on an external package `B`, and `B` asks

     * and it selects `C@1.2.9`, then that will be installed for B instead of `C@1.5.0`.  Whereas if the
     * preferred version was `C@~2.0.0` then it would have no effect, because this is incompatible
     * with `C@^1.0.0`.  A compatible parent dependency will take precedence over the preferred version;
     * for example if `A` had a direct dependency on `C@1.2.2`, then `B` would get `C@1.2.2` regardless of the
     * preferred version.
     *
     * Rush's implementation relies on the package manager's heuristic for avoiding duplicates by
     * trying to reuse dependencies requested by a parent in the graph:  The preferred versions
     * are simply injected into the fake common/temp/package.json file that acts as the root
