/**
 * A conservative set of decorators intended for use in both NodeJS and web browser projects.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This package provides a small set of decorators that enable more rigorous specification
 * of API contracts when using the TypeScript language.  The intent is to better document
 * expected behaviors and catch common mistakes.  This package is not intended to be a
 * general toolkit of language extensions or helpful macros.
