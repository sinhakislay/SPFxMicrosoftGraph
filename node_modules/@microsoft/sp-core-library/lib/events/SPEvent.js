/**
 * Represents a framework event that components can subscribe to.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Examples of events in a web application might include: the user clicking a button, the system navigating to
 * another page, or an item being added/removed from an abstract collection.  The SharePoint Framework
 * represents events using instances of the SPEvent object, one for each kind of event.  The SPEvent object
 * is typically exposed as a property of an associated class (e.g. the button that can be clicked).
 * When a component is interested in an event, it calls add() to register an event handler callback that
 * will be invoked each time the event occurs.  The handler receives an SPEventArgs parameter that may
 * provide additional details about what happened.  This is analogous to the browser's Document Object Model
 * (DOM) events.  The main difference is the ISPEventObserver feature, which tracks which component subscribed
 * to each event, and automatically unsubscribes the handler when the component is disposed.
 *
 * When an event is raised, all handlers are invoked synchronously.  The order in which event handlers
 * are called is unspecified.  The event handler callback must catch any exceptions that occur during
 * processing; an uncaught exception will not prevent other handlers from executing, but it will be
 * reported as a problem with the associated component.
 *
