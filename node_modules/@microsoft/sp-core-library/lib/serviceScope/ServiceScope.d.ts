/**
 * The service locator pattern used by the SharePoint Framework.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ServiceScope provides a formalized way for components to register and consume dependencies
 * ("services"), and to enable different implementations to be registered in different scopes.
 * This improves modularity by decoupling components from their dependencies in an extensible way.
 *
 * For example, suppose that various components need access to an IPageManager instance.  We could
 * simply make the PageManager a singleton (i.e. global variable), but this will not work e.g. if
 * we need to create a pop-up dialog that requires a second PageManager instance.  A better solution
 * would be to add the PageManager as a constructor parameter for each component that requires it,
 * however then we immediately face the problem that any code that calls these constructors
 * also needs a PageManager parameter.  In an application with many such dependencies, business
 * logic that ties together many subsystems would eventually pick up a constructor parameter
 * for every possible dependency, which is awkward.  A natural solution would be to move all the
 * dependencies into a class with name like "ApplicationContext", and then pass this around as our
 * constructor parameter.  This enables the PageManager to be passed to classes that need it
 * without cluttering the intermediary classes that don't.  However, it still has a design problem
 * that "ApplicationContext" has hard-coded dependencies on many unrelated things.  A more flexible
 * approach is to make it a dictionary that can look up items for consumers/providers who know the
 * right lookup key (i.e. ServiceKey).  This is the popular "service locator" design pattern,
 * familiar from the SPContext API in classic SharePoint.
 *
 * ServiceScope takes this idea a step further in two important ways:  First, it provides a scoping
 * mechanism so that e.g. if we have two different pages, they can each provide a unique PageManager
 * instance while still sharing other common dependencies.  Secondly, it allows for a ServiceKey
 * to provide a default implementation of the dependency.  This is important for API stability in
 * our modular client-side environment:  For example, suppose that version 2.0 of our application
 * introduced a new IDiagnosticTracing interface that a version 2.0 component will expect to consume.
 * If the version 2.0 component gets loaded by an older 1.0 application, it would fail.  We could
 * fix this by requiring each consumer to check for any missing dependencies and handle that case,
 * but it would require a lot of checks.  A better solution is to ensure that a default implementation
 * always exists, perhaps just a trivial behavior, so that components can assume that consume() will
 * always return some object that implements the contract.
 *
 * Usage: ServiceScope instances are created by calling either ServiceScope.startNewRoot() or
 * ServiceScope.startNewChild().  They are initially in an "unfinished" state, during which provide()
 * can be called to register service keys, but consume() is disallowed.  After ServiceScope.finish()
 * is called, consume() is allowed and provide() is now disallowed.  These semantics ensure that
 * ServiceScope.consume() always returns the same result for the same key, and does not depend on
 * order of initialization.  It also allows us to support circular dependencies without worrying
 * about infinite loops.  (Circular dependencies are best avoided, however this is difficult to
 * guarantee when working with components that were contributed by various third parties without
 * any coordination.)  To avoid mistakes, it's best to always call consume() inside a callback from
 * serviceScope.whenFinished().
