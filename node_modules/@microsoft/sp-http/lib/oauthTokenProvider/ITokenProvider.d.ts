/**
 * This class allows a developer to obtain OAuth2 tokens from Azure AD.

 * OAuth2 tokens are used to authenticate the user from the SharePoint page

 *
 * @remarks
 * AadTokenProvider is replacing the /_api.SP.OAuth.Token/Acquire endpoint
 * for authentication with ADAL.js. At some point in the near future, when Azure AD v2.0
 * can support the same scenarios as the original version, we will switch to MSAL.
