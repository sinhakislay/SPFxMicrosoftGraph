/**
 * The Response subclass returned by methods such as HttpClient.fetch().

 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * This class exposes the same members as our typings for the browser's native
 * Response and Body classes, which is why we can say that it "implements" them.
 * It cannot actually inherit from Response because that class does not have a copy
 * constructor (because it would probably be inefficient to copy the response stream).
