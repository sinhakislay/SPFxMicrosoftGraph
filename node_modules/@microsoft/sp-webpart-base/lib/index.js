/**
 * SharePoint Framework support for building web parts.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This package defines the APIs used by developers to create a custom web part.
 * A web part is a reusable visual object that a page author can add to their content,
 * and customize using a property pane.  Examples of web parts include an embedded
 * video player, a map, a group calendar, a chart, etc.
