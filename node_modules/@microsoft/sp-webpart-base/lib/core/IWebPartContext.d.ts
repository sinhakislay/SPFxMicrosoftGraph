/**
 * The base context interface for client-side web parts.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A "context" object is a collection of well-known services and other
 * objects that are likely to be needed by any business logic working with
 * a component.  Each component type has its own specialized extension of
 * this interface, e.g. IWebPartContext for web parts, IExtensionContext for
 * client-side extensions, etc.
 *
 * @deprecated - This interface will be removed in an upcoming release.  Use the
 * {@link WebPartContext} class instead.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 *
 * NOTE: The context object is a convenience that avoids the overhead of
 * properly factoring the dependencies for each class in your project,
 * in a situation where most classes have essentially the same dependencies.
 * If lots of members are added to the context without displine, it can
 * easily devolve into a poor engineering practice (where "everything depends
 * on everything else").  Think carefully before adding more objects to this
 * interface.
 *
 * Only add data properties or well-defined classes with ubiquitous applicability.
 * Do not add loose functions, callbacks, or settable properties.
 *
